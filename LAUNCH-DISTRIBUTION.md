  Show HN: faf-mcp – Universal MCP server for persistent AI context

  We built a universal MCP server that works with Claude Desktop, Cursor,
  Windsurf, Cline, and all MCP-compatible platforms.

  Key features:
  - IANA-registered format (application/vnd.faf+yaml)
  - Context-Mirroring: One project.faf → native files for all platforms
  - 50 MCP tools bundled
  - FREE FOREVER (MIT License)

  "Use FAF to initialize your project" - that's it. 30 seconds vs 20 minutes
  of context setup.

  npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/faf-mcp

  Hey Product Hunt! 👋

  We created faf-mcp after seeing developers struggle with AI context
  across different platforms (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

  The problem: Each platform wants its own context file (.cursorrules,
  .windsurfrules, CLAUDE.md). Maintaining 4 files is a nightmare.

  Our solution: One project.faf file → automatic sync to all platforms.

  Built with F1-inspired engineering:
  - 16.2x faster than CLI alternatives
  - 19ms average execution
  - Zero memory leaks
  - Championship-grade TypeScript

  It's FREE FOREVER (MIT License). We're not building a SaaS - we're
  building infrastructure.

  Try it: npm install -g faf-mcp

  Would love your feedback!

  ```
  We built a universal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that works
  across Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and all MCP platforms.

  Key innovation: Context-Mirroring
  - One project.faf file (IANA-registered format)
  - Automatically syncs to .cursorrules, .clinerules, .windsurfrules, CLAUDE.md
  - Bi-directional: changes in any file sync back

  Performance:
  - 50 MCP tools bundled
  - 16.2x faster than spawning CLI processes
  - 19ms average execution
  - Strict TypeScript, zero runtime errors

  FREE FOREVER - MIT License
