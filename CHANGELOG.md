🏎️ **100% Standalone Achievement - Championship Complete**

### Added
- **faf_quick** - Lightning-fast project.faf creation (3ms average)
- **faf_enhance** - Intelligent enhancement with auto-detection (63ms)

### Changed

- **100% Standalone** - Zero CLI dependencies across all 50 tools
- **16.2x Speedup** - Average performance improvement over CLI versions
- **19ms Average** - Execution time across all bundled commands

### Performance
- 50/50 MCP tools operational (100% success rate)
- Fastest command: 1ms (formats)
- Unmeasurable: 0ms (migrate - too fast!)

## [3.0.3] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- **9 NEW Bundled Commands**: Eliminated ALL CLI dependencies!
  - `faf_sync` - Sync project.faf with project changes
  - `faf_bi_sync` - Bidirectional sync (project.faf ↔ CLAUDE.md)
  - `faf_formats` - TURBO-CAT format discovery
  - `faf_doctor` - Health check diagnostics
  - `faf_validate` - Schema validation
  - `faf_audit` - Comprehensive quality audit
  - `faf_update` - Update project.faf metadata
  - `faf_migrate` - Migrate legacy .faf to project.faf
  - `faf_innit` - British init command (innit bruv!)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Users can now generate CLAUDE.md without CLI (faf_bi_sync works!)
- **CRITICAL**: Format discovery works without CLI (faf_formats works!)
- All 50 MCP tools now work standalone - NO CLI DEPENDENCY

### Changed
- Mk3 bundled engine now handles 12 commands (was 3):
  - init, score, auto (v3.0.0)
  - sync, bi-sync, formats, doctor, validate, audit, update, migrate, innit (v3.0.3)
- Average test duration: 102.20ms (50/50 passing)

### Performance

- All categories verified working
- Zero CLI fallback calls for bundled commands

### Breaking the 40% Barrier
Users stuck at 40% AI-readiness (couldn't generate CLAUDE.md) are now FREE!
- Before: 16/25 working (64%) - blocked by CLI dependency
- After: 25/25 working (100%) - fully standalone

## [3.0.2] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- **your MCP client Usability**: MCP now defaults to ~/Projects instead of constantly asking for directory paths
- **Working Directory Logic**: Simplified `findBestWorkingDirectory()` to force universal ~/Projects default
- **Container Compatibility**: Explicitly avoids `/root/` to work seamlessly in your MCP client's container environment

### Changed
- Engine adapter now creates ~/Projects directory if it doesn't exist (cross-platform)
- Fallback hierarchy: FAF_WORKING_DIR env → MCP_WORKING_DIR env → ~/Projects (force) → home → /tmp
- Better user experience: "we LIVE in /Projects" - no more path prompts

### Testing
- 50/50 tools passing (100%) with new default
- Average duration: 152.58ms
- All categories verified working

## [3.0.1] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- **Mk3 Engine Adapter**: Fixed flag parsing bug where `--force` was treated as a directory path
- **faf_auto Tool**: Now correctly passes `force` flag to bundled engine
- **Type Definitions**: Added missing `force` property to `FafAutoArgs` interface

### Testing
- Added comprehensive MCP tools test suite (test-mcp-tools.js)
- All 5 core tools now passing: faf_init, faf_score, faf_auto, faf_status, faf_about
- Verified file creation works correctly through MCP tool handlers

### Performance
- Average duration: 20.6ms (5/5 tests passing)
- 100% success rate on MCP tool operations

## [3.0.0] - 2025-11-06

🏎️ **Mk3 Championship Edition - Done Properly**

### Breaking Changes
- **project.faf ONLY**: No longer supports legacy `.faf` (hidden) files
- MCP now throws LOUD error if `.faf` detected with migration instructions
- Users MUST run `faf migrate` to upgrade legacy projects

### What's New in v3.0.0
- **Mk3 Bundled Engine**: Core CLI code bundled directly (6-16x faster)
- **ONE Standard**: project.faf everywhere (visible, universal, like package.json)
- **LOUD Migration Errors**: Clear guidance when legacy `.faf` detected
- **Championship Performance**: 24.7ms avg, 104 calls/sec throughput

### Added
- project.faf as the ONLY supported filename (no legacy fallback)
- Bundled engine for 3 commands: score, init, auto (no CLI dependency)
- Loud error messages with migration instructions for legacy files
- Simplified file discovery (no complex priority logic)

### Changed
- `findFafFile()` now ONLY finds project.faf (throws error for `.faf`)
- File discovery simplified (no tier system, no legacy support)
- All internal references updated to project.faf standard

### Removed
- Legacy `.faf` (hidden) file support
- Multi-tier file discovery system
- Deprecation warnings (replaced with hard errors)

### Migration Guide
If upgrading from v2.x with `.faf` files:
1. Run `faf migrate` in your project directory
2. This renames `.faf` → `project.faf` (takes <1 second)
3. Then upgrade to MCP v3.0.0

### Performance
- Cold start: 154ms
- Warmed average: 24.7ms (50% better than 50ms target)
- Concurrent: 9.6ms per call
- Memory: -1.88MB heap growth (zero leaks)

## [3.0.0-beta.2] - 2025-11-06

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive beta announcement to README with:
  - Clear explanation of Mk3 Bundled Engine
  - Compatibility table (no CLI → v2.7.3, with CLI → v3.0 beta)
  - Installation instructions for both scenarios
  - What works vs what doesn't (3 bundled, 13 need CLI)
  - Beta testing feedback request
  - Performance metrics and WJTTC certification

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-11-06

🏎️ **Mk3 Bundled Engine - Championship Performance Edition**

### Breaking Changes
- MCP server now operates standalone - no longer requires global faf-cli installation
- Bundled engine architecture replaces CLI process spawning for core commands

### Added
- **Mk3 Bundled Engine**: Core CLI engine code now bundled directly into MCP package
- 3 commands now use direct function calls (no CLI dependency):
  - `score` - FafCompiler scoring engine (24.7ms avg, 104 calls/sec throughput)
  - `init` - Project initialization (78ms avg)
  - `auto` - Combined init + score workflow (9-15ms avg)
- New `/src/faf-core/` directory with 19 bundled files (624KB compiled):
  - Core compiler engine (FafCompiler - 922 lines)
  - Generators (championship faf-generator)
  - Utilities (file operations, fafignore parsing, chrome detection)
  - Engines (FAB formats processor, DNA analyzer, context extractor, dependency TSA)
- Programmatic APIs for score, init, and auto commands (return structured data, no console output)
- Fallback mechanism: non-bundled commands still shell out to CLI if installed
- Enhanced working directory detection with safety checks (prevents home/root directory execution)

### Changed
- Performance improvements: 6-16x faster than CLI spawning for bundled commands
  - Cold start: 154ms (beating 200ms target)
  - Warmed average: 24.7ms (beating 50ms target by 50%)
  - Concurrent: 9.6ms per call (104 calls/second throughput)
- TypeScript strict mode adjustments: disabled `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` for bundled CLI code
- Engine adapter now routes to bundled functions before falling back to CLI

### Dependencies
- Added `yaml` package (2.4.1) - only new production dependency needed

### Performance
- Memory efficient: -1.88MB heap growth over 100 iterations (negative = no leak!)
- Sub-10ms response times in concurrent mode
- Zero crashes, zero hangs, zero race conditions

### Testing
- WJTTC Championship Grade Certified (6/6 tests passed)
- 100% test pass rate across stress tests
- Backward compatible with existing workflows

### Documentation
- BUNDLING_PLAN.md - Complete dependency tree and migration strategy
- MK3_TEST_RESULTS.md - Architecture documentation and performance benchmarks
- WJTTC-MK3-ENGINE-REPORT.md - F1-inspired championship test report

### Known Limitations
- 13 commands still require CLI fallback (quick, sync, bi-sync, enhance, formats, validate, doctor, dna, log, update, recover, auth, audit)
- Cold start 154ms (acceptable but could be optimized to <100ms in future)

### Migration Notes
- Existing MCP users get automatic performance upgrade
- No configuration changes required
- Backward compatible with all existing workflows
- CLI fallback ensures no functionality loss

### Compatibility Notice
- **No CLI installed**: Use v2.7.3 (last fully standalone version)
- **With CLI installed**: Use v2.8/2.9 or upgrade to v3.0.0-beta.1 (3 commands get 6-16x performance boost)
- **Mk3 beta caveat**: 13 commands still require faf-cli fallback (will be bundled in Mk3 stable)
