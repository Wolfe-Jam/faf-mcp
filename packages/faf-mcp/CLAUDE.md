```
faf-mcp: UNIVERSAL MCP SERVER
├── Claude Desktop support
├── Cursor IDE support
├── Windsurf Editor support
├── VS Code support
└── Any MCP-compatible platform
```

**CRITICAL: faf-mcp IS THE UNIVERSAL PACKAGE**
- ✅ Works with ALL MCP platforms
- ✅ 100% standalone (bundled FAF engine)
- ✅ Based on proven claude-faf-mcp codebase
- ✅ Championship-grade performance
- ✅ Orange smiley icon everywhere

**The .faf Position in MCP:**

```
Platform      Context          Protocol
────────      ───────          ────────
Claude    →   .faf        →    MCP
Cursor    →   .faf        →    MCP
Windsurf  →   .faf        →    MCP
Any IDE   →   IANA Format →    Open Protocol
```

.FAF provides the standardized Context that makes the Model Context Protocol work for everyone.

## 🚨 NPM PUBLISH PROTOCOL - MANDATORY 🚨

**CRITICAL RULE: `npm publish` IS FORBIDDEN WITHOUT APPROVAL**

Before ANY npm publish of faf-mcp (or any FAF package):

1. **Follow the MCP Publish Checklist** at `/Users/wolfejam/FAF-GOLD/PLANET-FAF/PUBLISH-PROTOCOL.md`
2. **Run ALL checklist items** (build, tests, version, README, CHANGELOG, SKILL.md, etc.)
3. **Request approval** with checklist results in the format specified
4. **Wait for OFFICIAL GO!** from wolfejam

**Required approval signals:**
- ✅ **"GO!"** - Approved to publish
- ✅ **"GREEN LIGHT"** - Approved to publish
- ❌ Anything else - DO NOT PUBLISH

**Why this matters:**
- Trust is everything
- Universal package for ALL MCP platforms (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code)
- Production infrastructure for 13k+ developers
- Official Anthropic MCP steward responsibility
- One bad publish can damage reputation permanently

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. Professional. Boring. Trusted.**
